# **SpeechToText**
> ###### *version: 1.0*

Download latest files (*zip* or *tar.gz*) from [Release - SpeechToText](https://github.com/krecik0000/SpeechToText/releases/tag/Usefull).

There are two ways to start the program
- with main.py
- or SpeechToText.exe

<sub> :+1: For the first option, it's best to have the audio file in the same folder</sub>

**Steps to run project with main.py:**
> 1. Install packages from `requirements.txt`
###### packages: `SpeechRecognition` and `pydub`
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> 2. Run `main.py` script direct or via terminal
```
    python main.py
```
When you run the script, a hidden folder will be created in the same location containing the processed audio
